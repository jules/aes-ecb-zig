# AES cipher using ECB cipher mode

*Disclaimer: I know that this is a super weak cipher. I implemented this (1) to learn more about the inner workings of AES and (2) so that I can advance in the [cryptopals problem sets](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/7) which need a working ECB cipher. I wanted to implement it manually to increase my skill with Zig!*

## About

This is a Zig implementation of the AES-ECB cipher. It was created by following the [NIST documentation](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf) on AES.
